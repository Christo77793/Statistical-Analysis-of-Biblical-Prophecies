## Approach to Identify Patterns and Gain Insights

### 1. Descriptive Statistics:
   - Calculate the number of prophecies in different books and chapters.
   - Identify the most common themes and their frequency.

### 2. Visualization:
   - Use bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of prophecies, themes, and fulfillment status.
   - Thematic visualizations to highlight key areas of interest.

### 3. Comparative Analysis:
   - Compare the frequency and themes of prophecies across different books of the Bible.
   - Analyze the proportion of fulfilled versus unfulfilled prophecies.

### 4. Correlation and Pattern Analysis:
   - Use statistical tests to identify significant patterns or correlations between different variables (e.g., theme and fulfillment status).
   - Look for patterns in the timing and circumstances of prophecies.

### 5. Interpretative Discussions:
   - Discuss the significance of the patterns observed in the data.
   - Relate findings to historical and theological contexts.
